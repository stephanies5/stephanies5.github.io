          <h3>Does Racism stil exist?</h3>
          <h5>By Shannon Murray, <span class="w3-opacity">May 11, 2018</span></h5>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          
          <p>
         A 14 year old boy from Chicago is kidnapped, beaten, mutilated, and shot before being dumped into the Tallahatchie River.  The culprits are arrested but are exonerated.  The victim is Emmitt Till, and the year is 1955.  
	A 22 year old man in Sacramento, California was on the phone in his backyard when two police officers shot at him 20 times, believing he was armed.  He was shot 8 times, and before being treated for his wounds, he was handcuffed and not given CPR.  The officers are only put on administrative leave.  The victim is Stephon Clark, and the year is 2018.
	These are just two of the many instances where black people were unjustifiably murdered, and the suspects got off with no serious consequences.  The similarities drawn between these two occurrences are frightening, considering they happened over half a century apart.  Some people today believe that the racial issues in America are better than they were before.  However, this violence towards black people indicates that racism continues to be a massive issue in America. 
The National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence states more than 60 percent of youth from birth to 17 experience victimization, and this number is only increased for blacks.  The rates of violence are more increased towards black people, but is now being seen because of mass media.  It was also concluded that, homicide is the number one cause of death for African Americans from ages 15 to 24.
Social media has made a big impact on the violence that black people endure, especially from police.  Everyday, new videos arise of a white person calling the police on a black person for no given reason, or police forcefully arresting a suspect who is not resisting.  
Another story that had not even made national news was a lynching.  On April 14, Ramon Smith and Jarron Moreland were reported missing, and their dismembered bodies were found four days later.  Three white males were charged with this crime, aged 16, 22 , and 43.  The victims were abducted, shot and killed, stripped, then tied to cinder blocks and thrown in a pond.
Darren Martin, a former white house official, was moving into his apartment when the police showed up because neighbors called believing that Martin was breaking in.  The cops relayed the message to Martin, where the neighbors even went to say that he held a “possible weapon”.  Martin was held outside by three officers while his apartment was searched.  After 10 minutes, the NYPD believed he was telling the truth.
In another case, Desmond Marrow, a former NFL player, was slammed to the ground by police because they mistook his cell phone for a gun, which seems to be happening more often, but only towards black people.  
He was not resisting the arrest, even yelling at the officers, “I’m not even fighting back!”. 
 But the police continued to pin him down, gripping his neck, while he was continuously screaming, “I can’t breathe!”.  He appeared to be passed out when they finally stopped.
A black student was lifted off the ground and choked by a police officer.  Waffle House called the cops on him after he had just taken his little sister to prom, he was unarmed and not violent.
A group of white students in Tallahassee were in a car shooting a pellet gun out of their window while shouting racial slurs. 
A white man was accused of attempting to hire a hitman from a white supremacist group to lynch his black neighbor by burning a cross in his front yard and hanging him from a tree.
A Yale graduate student was taking a nap in the common room of her dorm, while a white student called the police.  She was interrogated and questioned if she even belonged there.
These are just a few of the many circumstances where blacks experienced violence and profiling.  
One horrifying reality in America, is the police involvement in these crimes.  They clearly overstep their boundaries, and go as far as to harm the people in custody.  While suspects like Nikolas Cruz from the Parkland shooting are calmly arrested, black suspects that have not committed a felony and aren’t resisting sometimes die in custody.  The police often claim they “fear for their life”, and use that as an excuse to harm African Americans or even draw their open weapon on them.  Some people believe that this means there is obviously something wrong in society if our officers are too trigger happy to actually protect the people.  It is terrifying how the protectors of our country can be the ones hurting us.
Recently, a recording artist released a song and music video that even shows violence against blacks.  Donald Glover or Childish Gambino’s music video for the song “This Is America” displays many symbols alluding to black mistreatment in America.  Glover personifies American racism by playing the character of Jim Crow.  The video displays gun and police violence, and how the weapons are treated carefully, while black corpses are dragged.  A huge message in the video is the mass hysteria that goes on in the background that no one notices because everyone is distracted by the pop culture in the front.  The social media pop culture desensitize the people from racial terror and make us blind to what is really happening in the world, and this is perfectly depicted in this video.
When one student was asked if racism still exists, they said, “It’s systematic.  Our structure in society, politics, and economics are all impacted by this system that was ingrained in our history.  Although, it originated many years ago, it is still apart of our history, whether we like it or not.  Us Americans need to continue enlightening people against racism and develop into a better country for all”.
Another student concludes, “Yes, racism a state of mind, and you cannot change people’s states of mind, no matter how hard you try.  Therefore, if someone believes they are better than anyone, for whatever reason, no laws will change their mind”.
I believe that this violence only shows how racism is still intact in American society.  Despite many people choosing not to believe in this serious problem, it is extremely relevant.  The violence towards blacks are only increasing with each crime going unnoticed and the criminals unpunished.  While the President also does not believe this is a national problem, the violence will continue.  Racism is still thrives in America, and the only thing we can do to stop it is to educate the people and learn from these mistakes.
