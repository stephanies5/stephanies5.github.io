<h2 class="headings">Governors Ball and Picking the shows</h2>

<p class="p2"> To buy tickets all you have to do is go on the website linked above. An all day pass gives access to all the shows at the gov ball. It is easier to buy the tickets ahead of time rather than at the festival. A standard pass is the best for your first time at the festival, you dont need to rent out a cabana.There are many shows going on at the same time dont try and see them all pick the ones you want to see the most.</p>
<h2 class="headings">Surviving the Show</h2>

<p class="p3">There are vendors at the festival but they can be pricey. It is best to bring lots of water and if you want your own food. Although the vendors are some of the best food trucks in NYC. The best thing to wear is cute and trendy clothing. In my experience its best to go with a group its much more fun that way.</p>
